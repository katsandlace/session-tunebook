# session-tunebook
Displays traditional tunes in a random order. If I get time, will later be expanded to group tunes into sessions, set weighting for different tune types, maybe allow others to save tunes to specific sessions. 

To run, click on tune-flashcards/index

session-abc-to-json-helper.html accepts a pasted abc from thesession.org, plus a couple of user-inputted values, and outputs something you can paste straight into tunes.json. 

abcjs from github.com/paulrosen/abcjs. I used v 6.6.0 (downloaded jan 26)
